- O'Reilly book by Ted Dunning and Ellen Friedman
- The book is free, because they are hoping it will serve as good marketing material for MapR Convergent Data Platform.
- Focuses on the larger issue of "Machine Learning is more than just developing a model and getting it into production."
- Talks about the need for a holistic approach to the cross-cutting concerns of ML that we will call "machine learning logistics" and "model management."
- Talks about the whole system from start to finish
- The book may be a bit dated, as it was published in 2017.
- The book itself provides useful content.  It's not just marketing material.  Every now and then, you see "tools like MapR Convergent Data Platform", etc.
