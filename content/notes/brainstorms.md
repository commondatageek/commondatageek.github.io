_Some unresearched, opinionated thoughts on making brainstorms as good as possible._

<!--more-->

---

**Diverge, then Converge**

- first go wide to explore the limits of the domain and get some creative ideas
- then focus in on the most promising ideas

---

**Timeboxed**

Open-ended thoughtwork can take up as much time as you're willing to give it.

Forward movement needs to happen at some point.

---

**Three is often a good number of participants for brainstorms.**

- more likely to get some diversity of experience and thought
- not so much diversity that you can't actually converge on anything
- everyone can still feel like an active participant in the conversation

---

**Brainstorms should have a very narrow focus.**

A clear goal or question can keep the domain from growing too wide.

You can't boil the ocean.

> - You can’t pick a scope in advance and shut down anyone who strays from scope.

**Larger group brainstorms should have a facilitator.**

Keep things focused and on track.

---

**Larger groups might need to be split up.**

A large group could be split into several concurrent brainstorms (of 3 participants
each?) and brought back together at the end of a period of time.
