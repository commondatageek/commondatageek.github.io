## Jira is Rigid

It forces you to think about things in a very specific way.

It is fairly limited in the views that it provides of your data.

I hate having all of the Issues from EVERY SINGLE PROJECT IN THE SAME BACKLOG!

Could be that we're using it wrong (one board for the team instead of one board
per project), but that's how people wanted to do it.  My hands are tied.


## Jira Power-Up for Trello!

Or are they?

I really like using Trello. It gives a lot of flexibility to lay things out the
way that makes sense to you.

It turns out that there is a Power-Up that integrates your Trello Board with an
instance of Jira.

Here's the description from the Power-Up page:

> Connect Jira and Trello to help all your teams work better together. The Jira
> Power-up allows you to...
> 
> - Link Jira issues to cards, connecting different Workspaces across your
>   organization.
> - View important issue information on the detailed card view.
> - See if your linked issues are done at glance (from the front of the card)
> - Automatically links the Jira issue back to a Trello card so everyone in your
>   team knows how something came to be.
> - Quickly jump to your Jira project by > creating a link on your board.

And from the support page:

> The Jira Power-Up has the following capabilities:
> 
> - Ability to attach a Jira issue to a card.
> - Ability to create a Jira issue from a card
> - Ability to track status of an issue from the front of the card
