## Jira

So, in my experience, Jira can feel quite rigid.

You are given a certain way to think about things that obviously assumes that
Scrum is the proper way to do software development.  And if you don't do Scrum,
or you do Scrum differently, you are forced to translate your mental model into
the mental model provided by Jira.  (Epics, Issues, Stories, Tasks, single
backlog, etc.)

This isn't the way this should work.  I shouldn't have to bend the way I think
about my work to match the names of tables in your database.

At the very least, you should provide a set of conceptual primitives that
are generic enough to be applicable to different styles of software
development.


## GitHub Projects

I think that [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects)
has it right.

You should check it out.  My favorite features are:

- Tight integration with GitHub issues
- Create as many Views of the project as you wish, each having its own set of filter criteria.
    - One for everything marked "on-call"
    - One for each member of our team, showing what is assigned to them
    - One for 
- Switch between Kanban Board and Spreadsheet layout for the same View
- The project can track issues in multiple repos
- You can assign more than one person to an Issue (HONESTLY, Jira!)


## Trello

Trello is also a wonderful thing, and is also part of the Atlassian Universe.
