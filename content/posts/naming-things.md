## Two types of thinking

First, the conscious, logical mind.  The "sophisticated" mind.

- Define your objective
- Let's break it down
- make a plan
- execute
- measure

We use this any time we want to command and control the universe around us.
It's about, as much as possible, bending the universe to our will to give us
what we want.

Secondly, the child's mind, the learner's mind, the subconcious mind.

- observes
- perceives
- watches
- listens
- remembers
- considers

We rarely use this mind.


## Naming Things

The joke about two hardest things in computer science:

- naming things
- cache invalidation

Was the guy just being funny?  Or did he really mean it when he said "naming
things" ?

I think, in fact, it's **all** about naming things.  That's the number one
thing we can do to understand and manage this world we live in.

The universe doesn't give us "concepts".

The universe doesn't give us types, names, labels, hierarchies, taxonomies, ontologies, classes, species, genuses, orders, composition, decomposition or anything else.

Exiatence just /is/.  All of it.  All at once.  Always.


## Trees

Do you know what a tree is?  Do you really?

- Is it the leaves?
- Is it the branches?
- Is it the animals that live in the branches?
- Is it the bees that carry pollen from tree to tree?
- Is it the trunk?
- Is it the infection of beetles in the trunk?
- Is it the roots?

What combination of all the aboe things is considered "part of the tree"? Moreover:

- Is it the soil?
- Is it the bacteria in the soil?
- Is it the chemistry of the soil that allows the bacteria to do what they do?
- Is it the atmosphere of the earth that is what it is and interacts with the
  soil?
- Is it the Sun that makes the atmosphere what it is?

Do you really know what a tree is?


## Things and concepts and words aren't real.

To fully comprehend ANYTHING is to fully comprehend EVERYTHING.

The universe just is.  It doesn't give us any concepts for free.  It doesn't
put names on anything.  It doesn't distinguish one thing from another.  There
are no "things".  It just IS.

The problem is, your brain doesn't work that way.  You can **observe** in a
holistic way, but you can't **reason** in a holistic way.  We simply have to be
able to break things down and work on them one by one.

So all "concepts" and "things" are what we humans decided they should be.  We
put words on it, set some boundaries on it, and off we go.

And this is why your ability to experience and reason about the world around
you tends to be limited by words of your native language. (Worf/Sapir Hypothesis)

We made it all up.  These "things" and "concepts" are an artifact of the way
that our brains work.  They certainly didn't come from the universe.

This is so different from just experiencing all things as they are, without
judgment.


## The Concept is Everywhere

- the word "analysis" means to cut it up
- Conventional wisdom that hard problems should be split up into smaller
  problems.
- The saying "divide and conquer"
- "depends on how you slice and dice it"
- "six of one, half dozen of the other"

- Computing
    - "tightly coupled" / "loosely coupled"
    - Modularity
    - Abstract trees
    - composability
    - tree structures
    - set logic
    - types, classes, interfaces, inheritance
    - break off one branch, replace it with another, nobody knows or cares
    - Namespaces
    - Modules
    - Packages
    - Partitions
    - Idempotency?
    - Bounded contexts
    - Interfaces (a defined boundary between two systems)
    - Functional programming
    - Referential Transparency
    - Classes
    - Methods
    - Functions
    - Variables
    - Putting a good name on all of these things
    - Libraries
    - Hierarchical Filesystems
    - Set Logic makes reasoning about state possible


## Start at the end

- Start with a goal.  Give it a good name.
    - A good name is:
    - descriptive of the thing
    - only the thing (not all the other kinds of things)
    - unambiguous with all the other things
    - Separated!
    - Like sets!
    - Crisp semantics
- Ask yourself, what are the smallest, purest, best-named things that are
  prerequisite for this goal?
    - Good names!
    - It's really all about names!

So the guy was really onto something when he said that one of the two hardest
problems in computer science was naming things.
